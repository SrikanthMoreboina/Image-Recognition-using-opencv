Image Recognition using OpenCV
This repository contains a project for image recognition using OpenCV, a powerful library for computer vision and image processing. The project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for detecting and recognizing objects in images. It includes code for face detection, object classification, and basic image preprocessing.

FEATURES
Face Detection: Detect faces in images using Haar cascades or deep learning-based detectors.
Object Classification: Classify objects in images using pre-trained deep learning models.
Image Preprocessing: Perform various image preprocessing tasks such as resizing, normalization, and edge detection.

ABOUT THE MODEL AND DATASET:

YOLOv3 Weights:
The yolov3.weights file can be downloaded from the YOLO website: YOLOv3 Weights

YOLOv3 Configuration:
The yolov3.cfg file can be found in the YOLO GitHub repository: YOLOv3 Configuration
You can download this file directly by navigating to the above link and clicking on the "Raw" button, then saving the content as a .cfg file.

COCO Names:
The coco.names file, which contains the class labels, can also be found in the YOLO GitHub repository: COCO Names
Similarly, you can download this file by navigating to the above link, clicking on the "Raw" button, and saving the content as a .names file.

YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) is a popular object detection model known for its speed and accuracy. Here are some key points about YOLOv3.
YOLOv3 is designed for real-time object detection. It can process images and videos quickly while maintaining high accuracy.
Unlike traditional object detection models that use region proposal networks, YOLOv3 performs object detection in a single pass through the network. This makes it significantly faster.

OPENCV FUNCTIONS USED:
The haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file is a pre-trained model file used for face detection in OpenCV. It is part of the Haar cascade classifier family, which are object detection algorithms capable of detecting objects in images and videos.
